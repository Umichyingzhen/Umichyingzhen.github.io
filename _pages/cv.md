**Graduate Research Assistant**  
_Department of Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics at University of Michigan_ — Ann Arbor, MI (May 2025 - July 2025)
- Conducted spatial transcriptomics analysis on normal vs. Alzheimer’s mouse brains using spatial pattern and differential expression (SPADE) algorithm, identifying over 13,000 spatially variable genes with high sensitivity to local expression heterogeneity
- Performed clustering and domain detection with the BASS package and integrated Seurat-based differential expression analysis to compare spatial domain-specific vs. localized gene expression  
- Demonstrated that SPADE is good at detecting fine-scale localized differences, while Seurat capturing domain-level transcriptional changes, providing complementary insights into Alzheimer’s-related gene dysregulation
- Built reproducible workflows on Great Lakes HPC with R&Python environments, executing Slurm jobs for the 3000*30000 expression matrix through VS Code

**Graduate Research Assistant**  
_Department of Biostatistics at University of Michigan_ — Ann Arbor, MI (May 2025 - Sep 2025)
- Designed and implemented elliptical slice sampling algorithms in R for Bayesian parameter estimation, improving efficiency in posterior inference
- Developed and validated a Multivariate Bayesian Shrinkage Prior (Mt-MBSP) model supporting mixed-type outcomes (continuous, binary, count) with Gibbs sampling  
- Conducted extensive simulation studies comparing Bayesian CRD, Bayesian CRD with imputation, and OLS, evaluating predictive accuracy and convergence via Gelman-Rubin diagnostics
- Applied Bayesian modeling frameworks to real and simulated datasets, generating reproducible analyses and visualizations that supported model validation and interpretation

**Manager Assistant**  
_China Everbright Bank, Changchun Branch_ — Changchun, China (September 2019 - November 2019)
- Gathered and processed the monthly economic data of Jilin Province and the whole country since 2019 to understand the GDP drivers from the perspectives of fiscal policy and monetary policy
- Learned the business models and daily operations of commercial banks; recommended appropriate wealth management products to potential clients based on their risk tolerance and investment needs  
- Employed R to fit generalized and linear regression models for customer satisfaction and deposit analysis
  
Research Experience
======

**Research on Pneumonia Patient Condition Classification Using Diffusion Models and CLIP**  
_Department of Biostatistics at University of Michigan_ — Ann Arbor, MI (Nov 2024 - Dec 2024)
- Deployed the stable Diffusion model and utilized LoRA to fine-tune the model to make the model generate customized chest X-ray images
- Utilized the fine-tuned contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model to achieve modest improvements in training accuracy and classify the test dataset  
- Publish the whole research on GitHub https://github.com/xxm12345666/biostat625-group2-project.git

**Research on Predictive Algorithms for Cardiovascular Disease**  
_Summer Research Seminar, Supervisor: R. Todd Ogden, Columbia University_ — Remote (May 2023 - July 2023)
- Utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify relevant predictors and reduce dimensionality in complex datasets, implemented backward stepwise elimination to refine model features and prevent overfitting
- Developed random forest and logistic regression models to assess CHD risk factors and aid in early detection  
- Evaluated model performances based on confusion matrix and AUC-ROC curve values
- Validated that the random forest model outperformed other models in categorizing high-dimensional data

**Familial Influences on Radiation Effects in Mice**  
_NASA Human Research Program, Weil Lab, Colorado State University_ — Fort Collins, CO (May 2022 – August 2022)
- Designed and fitted a generalized linear mixed model for the analysis of the relationship among Modified Merriam-Focht classification and radiation groups
- Detected the difference in radiation effects between γ-rays and HZE nuclei using emmeans command  
- Achieved regression analysis for the odds of being vision impairing caused by gamma rays using R

**Application of Nonlinear Programming to Heat Conduction Model**  
_College of Science at Yanbian University_ — Yanji, China (August 2017 - October 2018)
- Established a nonlinear programming model to determine optimal thickness of the second layer of the high temperature working clothes given predictors like work hours and environmental temperature
