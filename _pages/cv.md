Work Expreience

**Graduate Research Assistant**  
_Department of Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics at University of Michigan_ — Ann Arbor, MI (May 2025 - July 2025)
- Conducted spatial transcriptomics analysis on normal vs. Alzheimer’s mouse brains using SPADE, identifying over 13,000 spatially variable genes with high sensitivity to local expression heterogeneity
- Performed clustering and domain detection with the BASS package and integrated Seurat-based differential expression analysis to compare spatial domain-specific vs. localized gene expression  
- Demonstrated that SPADE is good at detecting fine-scale localized differences, while Seurat capturing domain-level transcriptional changes, providing complementary insights into Alzheimer’s-related gene dysregulation
- Built reproducible workflows on Great Lakes HPC with R&Python environments, executing Slurm jobs for the 3000*30000 expression matrix through VS Code
