### Abstract
The minimum living allowance (dibao) is a social security system for low-income families. With the establishment and continuous development of urban and rural dibao in China, more and more people have benefited from it. However, a precise dibao model has not yet been established, making its construction an urgent issue to be addressed. In this paper, we collected relevant data from Jilin Province from 2010 to 2016, and then conducted principal component regression. Considering the relationship between indicator variables and time, we employed the commonly used Gaussian function to fit this relationship. Combining these two aspects, we established a mathematical model for urban and rural dibao standards in a specific region, and carried out analysis and verification using R software and MATLAB.
