### üì¶ Package Features

- **Residual Standard Error (RSE)**: Compute the residual standard error for linear regression models.  
- **R-Squared (\(R^2\))**: Calculate the coefficient of determination to assess model fit.  
- **Adjusted R-Squared**: Evaluate the adjusted \(R^2\), accounting for the number of predictors in the model.  
- **F-test**: Evaluate the overall significance of a multiple linear model, including F-statistic, p-value, and degrees of freedom.  
- **T-test**: Evaluate the significance of individual predictors, including estimate, standard error, t-statistic, and p-value.
