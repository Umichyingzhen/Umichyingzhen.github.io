### ðŸ§© Model Implementation and Design

- **Bayesian CRD for Mixed-Type Responses**  
  - Multivariate regression with responses {continuous, binary, count}; covariates split into internal `Z` and external-driven features via predictive draws  
  - Latent Gaussian random effects `U` capture residual correlation; outcome-specific working weights handle different likelihoods  
  - Shrinkage prior on coefficients via localâ€“global parameters `(zeta, nu, tau)`

- **Mt_MBSP (Gibbs) Sampler**  
  - **Binary**: PÃ³lyaâ€“Gamma augmentation; update `W`, latent `Y*`, then coefficients `B`  
  - **Continuous**: Gaussian working model with `W=1`  
  - **Count**: Negative-binomial via PÃ³lyaâ€“Gamma; updates dispersion `r_disp`  
  - Cycle updates: `U | ...` (Gaussian), `Î£ | ...` (Inverse-Wishart), local scales `zeta` (GIG) and `nu` (Gamma)  
  - Generate predictive draws `Bpred_samples` (stored as `Y_t`) for downstream CRD

- **Elliptical Slice Sampler (CRD-impute)**  
  - **Parameter block**: `theta = [beta_Z, beta_B, log(sigma^2), log(kappa), log(lambda)]`  
  - Gaussian prior with diagonal covariance; bracketed angle sampling without step sizes  
  - Uses rolling `Bdraws` from `fit$Bpred_samples` (or imputed draws) to couple CRD with Mt_MBSP predictions

- **Discrepancy Measures**  
  - **Spearman**: rank-based `W` from normalized ranks  
  - **Kendall**: pairwise concordance/discordance construction in `ComputeWmatrix(...)` 

- **Baselines & Shrinkage Variants**  
  - **OLS** baseline for MSE comparison  
  - **Bayesian Lasso**: per-coordinate local scales `lambda_j^2`, Gibbs updates, posterior means for `beta`  
  - **Bayesian Ridge**: conjugate updates with closed-form posterior `(mu_n, V_n)` and Inverse-Gamma for `sigma^2`

- **Evaluation Protocols**  
  - **Prediction**: MSE on new data; binary tasks use ROC/AUC and PR/AUPRC  
  - **Convergence**: trace plots, ACF, cumulative means; Gelmanâ€“Rubin PSRF from split chains  
  - **Visualization**: posterior densities, beta-correlation heatmaps, error boxplots

- **Simulation Designs**  
  - **Sim 1**: Linear truth with `n = {50,100}`; CRD (with/without imputation) vs OLS  
  - **Sim 1b**: Sparse beta (only first coefficient nonzero) stress-tests shrinkage  
  - **Sim 2**: External Weibull model estimates `beta_E`; integrates ranks into CRD; analyzes `Dbar_i` regression on `Z`  
  - **Sim 3**: Bayesian Lasso comparison  
  - **Sim 4**: Bayesian Ridge (conjugate) comparison  
  - **Sim 5**: External beta scenarios (`bext_1`, `bext_2`, `bext_3x10`, `first_only`, `mixed`) to probe generalization

- **Default Settings & Libraries**  
  - Seeds (e.g., 970316) for reproducibility  
  - `Mt_MBSP`: `niter=500`, `burn=100`; **CRD-ESS**: `T=1000`; typical `kappa=1`, `sigma0_sq=3`, `sigma_kappa_sq=3`, `sigma_l_sq=1`; small \( \nu \) (e.g., 0.1); scenario-specific \( \eta \)  
  - R packages: `MASS`, `mvtnorm`, `GIGrvg`, `MCMCpack`, `BayesLogit`, `pROC`, `PRROC`, `caret`, `ggplot2`, `pheatmap`, `loo`


### ðŸ“‘ Results

> - The fitted comparison for CRD-impute at p = 3 shows that posterior mean estimates (red) align more closely with the 45Â° diagonal than in other settings, indicating improved predictive accuracy.  
> - Linear regression (blue) captures broader variation but with higher scatter around the diagonal, suggesting larger variance and less stability compared to CRD.  
> - Overall, CRD provides more consistent predictions around the true values, highlighting its robustness in moderate dimensions.  

<img src="/files/densities of Beta.png" style="width:100%;"/>

> - The posterior density plots for p = 5 illustrate distinct shrinkage behavior across coefficients beta1â€“beta5.  
> - Beta1 and Beta2 remain centered near their true signals, while Beta3â€“Beta5 concentrate closer to zero, demonstrating effective shrinkage under the prior.  
> - The spread of densities indicates uncertainty remains for weaker coefficients, but the framework still manages to separate strong from weak effects, validating the role of shrinkage priors.

> - At n = 50, Bayesian CRD with Spearman discrepancy achieved MSE = 1.1516, slightly better than Least Squares (MSE = 1.1584), while maintaining PSRF â‰ˆ 1.07 for convergence stability.  
> - At n = 100, Bayesian CRD (Spearman) reached MSE = 1.1210, nearly identical to OLS (1.1216), but with reliable convergence diagnostics (PSRF â‰ˆ 1.09), unlike OLS.  
> - Bayesian CRD with imputation showed mixed performance: Spearman discrepancy increased error (MSE â‰ˆ 1.18 at n=50), but Kendall discrepancy at n=100 gave the **lowest** error (MSE = 1.0776) across all methods, highlighting its adaptability.   
> - Overall, while OLS matched Bayesian CRD at larger n, the Bayesian framework provided convergence assurance and superior performance with Kendall discrepancy at higher sample sizes.
