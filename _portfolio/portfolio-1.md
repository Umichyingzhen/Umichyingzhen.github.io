This study applies spatial transcriptomics to analyze gene expression in Alzheimer’s disease mouse brains. SPADE and Seurat are used to identify spatially variable genes and to evaluate their relative sensitivity. The analysis highlights both overlapping and method-specific detections, showing that the two approaches provide complementary perspectives on spatial gene expression relevant to Alzheimer’s pathology.
