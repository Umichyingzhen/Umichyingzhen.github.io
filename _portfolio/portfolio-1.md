This study applies spatial transcriptomics to analyze gene expression in Alzheimer’s disease mouse brains. SPADE and Seurat are used to identify spatially variable genes and to evaluate their relative sensitivity. The analysis highlights both overlapping and method-specific detections, showing that the two approaches provide complementary perspectives on spatial gene expression relevant to Alzheimer’s pathology.

### 🧠 Project Summary

- **Dataset**: The dataset contains spatial transcriptomics profiles from Alzheimer’s disease and normal mouse brain sections, with thousands of spatial spots and gene expression counts measured across more than 15,000 genes  
- **Key Methods**: SPADE for normalization and spatially variable gene detection; Seurat for preprocessing, clustering, and differential expression; BASS for multi-sample spatial domain alignment; visualization of spatial gene expression patterns using ggplot2  
- **Main Finding**: Higher alcohol consumption is significantly associated with elevated systolic blood pressure, especially among younger adults.

> **Adjusted R²**: 0.185  
> **Notable Results**:
> - 12+ drinks per year → +0.060 log-units in SBP (p = 0.001)
> - Each drink per day → +0.003 log-units (p < 0.001)
> - Negative interaction with age
