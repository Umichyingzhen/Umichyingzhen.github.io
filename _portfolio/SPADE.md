This study applies spatial transcriptomics to analyze gene expression in Alzheimerâ€™s disease mouse brains. SPADE and Seurat are used to identify spatially variable genes and to evaluate their relative sensitivity. The analysis highlights both overlapping and method-specific detections, showing that the two approaches provide complementary perspectives on spatial gene expression relevant to Alzheimerâ€™s pathology.

### ðŸ§  Project Summary

- **Dataset**: The dataset contains spatial transcriptomics profiles from Alzheimerâ€™s disease and normal mouse brain sections, with 3541 spatial spots and 32285 gene expression counts measured.
- **Key Methods**: SPADE for normalization and spatially variable gene detection; Seurat for preprocessing, clustering, and differential expression; BASS for multi-sample spatial domain alignment; visualization of spatial gene expression patterns using ggplot2; Capping algorithm for reducing computational burden.  
- **Main Finding**: SPADE showed higher sensitivity for detecting localized spatial expression differences, while the Seurat+BASS framework captured broader domain-specific gene expression. About 37% of significant genes differed between methods, reflecting their complementary strengths and methodological differences.

### ðŸ“ˆ Data Visualization Results

<img src="/files/Spatial_Domain_Facet.png" alt="Comparison of Spatial Domain Distributions in AD versus Normal mouse brain" style="width:100%;"/>
  
> - Domain 4 and Domain 7 expanded in AD compared to WT (p < 0.05)  
> - Domain 3 and Domain 8 showed shrinkage or relocation (p < 0.05)  
> - Spatial reorganization indicates potential degeneration in AD pathology

<img src="/files/Lhfp.png" alt="Conflict gene expression Lhfp" style="width:100%;"/>
  
> - Domain 7 shows the lowest adjusted p-value in the DE analysis, highlighting significant differential expression  
> - Cluster-based methods detect *Lhfp* as significant, consistent with higher relative expression intensity in Domain 7  
> - Despite DE significance, *Lhfp* is not classified as an SV gene by SAPDE, likely due to similar relative expression intensity across multiple regions

<img src="/files/Tuba1c.png" alt="Conflict gene expression Tuba1c" style="width:100%;"/>
  
> - Tuba1c shows generally low expression across both normal and AD tissues  
> - A localized region in domain 3 of AD exhibits higher relative expression, detected as significant by SPADE  
> - Cluster-based analysis did not classify Tuba1c as significant due to overall low and uniform expression  

<img src="/files/Domain_Size_vs_R.png" alt="Minimum domain size versus R that showing the threshold of 3% rule for spatial domain detection" style="width:100%;" />

> - The maximum number of spatial domains is approximately 33, based on the minimum 3% cells per domain threshold  
> - R values between 5 and 33 were evaluated, ensuring heterogeneity in gene expression is retained while avoiding noise from small domains  
> - Domain size of 8 is the largest one that satisfies the baseline requirement with greater than 3 percent of cells per domain  

### ðŸ“‹ Table Results

| Method           | Total Genes | Significant Genes | Percent (%) |
|------------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Seurat           | 32282       | 11812             | 36.59       |
| SPADE (Capping)  | 16279       | 13085             | 80.38       |

> - SPADE identified a higher number and proportion of significant genes compared to Seurat, despite processing fewer total input genes  
> - The increased detection rate from SPADE suggests greater sensitivity to spatially varying signals in raw gene expression data  
> - Combining Seurat (for pre-filtering) and SPADE (for sensitivity) is preferred for robust evaluation of spatial data significance

| Overlapping | Conflict | Only in Seurat | Only in SPADE |
|-------------|----------|----------------|---------------|
| 9639        | 5619     | 2173           | 3446          |

> - 9,639 genes were identified as significant by both Seurat and SPADE  
> - 5,619 genes show disagreement, with 2,173 detected only by Seurat and 3,446 only by SPADE  
> - Nearly 37% of significant genes fall into the conflict category, highlighting methodological differences between Seurat and SPADE
